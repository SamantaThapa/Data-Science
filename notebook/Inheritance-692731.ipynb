    "## Types of Inheritance in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports the following types of inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Single Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**  \n",
    "Single inheritance occurs when one child class inherits from exactly one parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "In this type of inheritance, a child class can access the attributes and methods of only one parent class. It is the simplest form of inheritance and is easy to understand and implement. Single inheritance improves code reuse while keeping the class structure simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Multiple Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**  \n",
    "Multiple inheritance occurs when a single child class inherits from more than one parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "The child class can access features from all its parent classes. Python resolves conflicts between parent classes using Method Resolution Order (MRO), which determines the order in which base classes are searched. This type of inheritance is powerful but can increase complexity if not used carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Multilevel Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**  \n",
    "Multilevel inheritance occurs when a class is derived from another class, which itself is derived from another class, forming a chain of inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "Each subclass inherits the properties and behaviors of its parent class and indirectly gains access to all ancestor classes. This type of inheritance is useful when modeling real-world hierarchical relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Hierarchical Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**  \n",
    "Hierarchical inheritance occurs when multiple child classes inherit from a single parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "All child classes share common properties and methods from the same parent class but may implement different behaviors. This approach reduces code duplication and improves consistency across related classes.\n"
